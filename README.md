# Overview
The Polygons class is a collection that generates and provides access to regular polygons, starting from a triangle (3 sides) up to a polygon with m sides, all inscribed in a circle of radius R. It provides methods to iterate over these polygons, access individual polygons by index, and determine which polygon has the maximum area-to-perimeter ratio (i.e., the most efficient polygon).

Initialization
m (int): The number of sides for the largest polygon in the sequence. Must be greater than 3.
R (float): The radius of the circle in which all polygons are inscribed.
Raises a ValueError if m is less than 3.

Methods
__len__():

Returns the number of polygons in the collection (i.e., m-2).
__repr__():

Returns a string representation of the Polygons object, showing the number of sides of the largest polygon and the radius R.
__getitem__(s):

Returns a polygon or a list of polygons depending on the type of the index s.
If s is an integer, it returns the polygon with s + 3 sides.
If s is a slice, it returns a list of polygons corresponding to the range specified by the slice.
__iter__():

Returns an iterator over the polygons in the collection, starting from the triangle (3 sides) up to the polygon with m sides.
max_efficiency_polygon:

Returns the polygon in the collection with the highest area-to-perimeter ratio.

# PolygonIterator Class
This is a nested class within Polygons that allows iteration over the polygons.

__init__(self, m, R): Initializes the iterator with m sides and radius R.
__iter__(self): Returns self to make it iterable.
__next__(self): Generates the next polygon in the sequence. Raises StopIteration when the end is reached.
Notes
This class assumes the existence of a Polygon class that provides properties like area and perimeter. Each polygon is generated as needed when accessed or iterated over.
The polygons are stored implicitly and generated on demand, making the Polygons class memory efficient for large sequences.
Error Handling
Raises ValueError if m is less than 3 during initialization.
Raises IndexError if an invalid index is provided to the __getitem__ method.

Example Usage
```from polygons import Polygons
  
  #Create a Polygons object
  polygons = Polygons(6, 1)
  
  #Get the number of polygons in the collection
  print(len(polygons))  # Output: 4 (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon)
  
  #Access individual polygons by index
  print(polygons[0])  # Output: Polygon with 3 sides
  print(polygons[1])  # Output: Polygon with 4 sides
  
  #Iterate over polygons
  for polygon in polygons:
      print(polygon)
  
  #Find the most efficient polygon
  efficient_polygon = polygons.max_efficiency_polygon
  print(efficient_polygon) ```
